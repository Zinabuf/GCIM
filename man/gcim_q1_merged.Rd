\arguments{
\item{qp_tar_phen}{File path to the phenotype and PRS data (tab-delimited).
Must contain at least:
FID, IID, Outcome, Add_PRS, Int_PRS, Cov_PRS, Covariate_Pheno.
Additional columns will be treated as confounders.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to print progress messages (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{model}{The fitted \code{lm} model object.}
\item{model_summary}{Summary of the fitted model.}
\item{merged_data}{Data frame used for model fitting.}
\item{formula}{The model formula used.}
\item{sample_size}{Number of observations used in the analysis.}
\item{variables}{Names of the variables in the model.}
\item{r_squared}{R-squared value of the model.}
\item{adj_r_squared}{Adjusted R-squared value of the model.}
\item{residual_se}{Residual standard error of the model.}
\item{f_statistic}{F-statistic for the overall model.}

\description{
Performs linear regression analysis for the Genetic Causality Inference Model (GCIM)
with quantitative outcomes, without including the main effect of the exposure's PRS
from own PRS data.
